# responsiveportfolio

This project involved using the Bootstrap CSS Framework to create a responsive Portfolio page, featuring an about me page, portfolio page, and a contact page. The navbar was created using the navbar component. I used the navbar-expand-sm class to ensure that the navbar links only vertically collapsed on small screens. The footer was created using a footer id and adding css to fix its position absolute to the html element. 

The about me page was laid out on the Bootstrap grid system, with a large parent container for the row and columns within it. The content was place within a container-lg, with differing column classes named for different responsive breakpoints, to ensure that the content was took up the full width of smaller screens. 

The portfolio page was created using the Card components from the Bootstrap framework. Again, a container-lg was used to separate the content from the background of the page, and grow to occupy a larger width of the screen on smaller screen sizes. These cards were placed in their respective columns, so that they would appear in two column rows on desktops and stack vertically on smaller screens. Here, some CSS styling was used to ensure that the card sizes matched the fixed size of the placeholder images. 

The contact page was created using Form and Button components from the Bootstrap framework. The same larger container and smaller container-lg was used to contain the contact content. 

This was a very helpful project as a first introduction to building responsive pages with the Bootstrap framework. The author looks forward to continuing to learn his way around this powerful tool.
